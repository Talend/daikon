== Glossary

- Category - each event is associated with a category like for example security, activity, failure. Each application
may use as many categories as required.

- MDC - Mapped Diagnostic Context (generally speaking a static map which holds context
to be associated with each logged event).


== Assumptions

- First release is targeted solely for 6.5 release to be used by TAC and MDM. Because of this,
only log4j 1.2 is supported.

- Each application decides which audit events to send, but for improved compatibility and reusability we
provide a set of predefined events.


== Analysis/Investigation

=== Problem Statement

Logging is essential part of any application. There are two kind of logs:

- technical logs are used to detect and analyze problems with application (bugs)
- audit logs are used to detect and analyze problems in how application is being used
(attempted attacks, malicious activities by authorized users, etc)

This framework provides means for logging and processing audit logs which can be reused by all Talend products.


=== Architecture

Audit Logging reuses Talend LogServer for storing and displaying audit logs, although it
treats them separately from normal logs (in particular, it stores them in a separate index and
provides separate dashboard).

On application side it provides dedicated Audit Logging API which builds its own pipeline
using the same framework as the application (but does it independently of normal logging configuration).

=== Use Cases

Overall, to start using Audit Logging it is necessary to:

. Add dependencies
. Create a configuration file
. Call the API

In most cases, the logs will be sent to LogStash which needs to have a special input configured (see Configuration section).

==== Adding dependencies

To start using Audit Logging client it's necessary to add the next dependencies.

WARNING: Audit Logging artifact group and id will change after moving it to daikon repository.

.For gradle:
[source,groovy]
----
compile "org.talend.daikon:daikon-audit:$auditLoggingVersion"

compile "org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12:1.7.25"

compile "log4j:log4j:1.2.17"
----

.For maven:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.talend.daikon</groupId>
    <artifactId>daikon-audit</artifactId>
    <version>...</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.25</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>log4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.17</version>
</dependency>
----


==== Configuration

Audit Logging client uses simple properties file
for all its configuration (in future, if needed, yaml-based configuration may be implemented).
It looks for the configuration file in the next places (in given order):

. Location specified in `talend.logging.audit.config` system property
. In classpath root, file named `audit.properties`

link:{audit_source_url}/src/main/resources/audit.properties.example[Here] is an example of the configuration file.

If audit events are to be sent to LogStash as in this example, it has to have an additional input in its configuration:

----
input {
  http {
    response_headers => {
      "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" => "*"
      "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" => "Content-Type, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, Authorization, X-Requested-With"
      "Access-Control-Allow-Methods" => "*"
      "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" => "*"
    }
    port => 8057
    type => "Audit"
    codec => "json"
  }
}
----

NOTE: Platform Service team provides LogServer with LogStash which is pre-configured for audit logging.


==== Logging a standard audit event

From applications perspective the basic use case is logging an audit event.
If it's one of the standard audit events, then all that is necessary to do is to create an instance of
{javadoc_url}/org/talend/logging/audit/StandardEventAuditLogger.html[StandardEventAuditLogger]
using {javadoc_url}/org/talend/logging/audit/AuditLoggerFactory.html[AuditLoggerFactory]:

[source,java]
----
StandardEventAuditLogger auditLogger = AuditLoggerFactory.getEventAuditLogger(StandardEventAuditLogger.class);
...
auditLogger.loginSuccess();
----

This code logs audit message corresponding to login success event attaching values from MDC.


==== Passing context explicitly

If application needs to pass context explicitly rather than via MDC it can be done like this:

[source,java]
----
StandardEventAuditLogger auditLogger = AuditLoggerFactory.getEventAuditLogger(StandardEventAuditLogger.class);
...
Context ctx = ContextBuilder.create("user", "testuser").build();
auditLogger.loginSuccess(ctx);
----

For details, see
{javadoc_url}/org/talend/logging/audit/Context.html[Context]
and {javadoc_url}/org/talend/logging/audit/ContextBuilder.html[ContextBuilder].


==== Passing an exception as a parameter

If there's an exception associated with audit event it can be passed as a parameter (some events
require an exception as a parameter, but basically it can be passed to any event):

[source,java]
----
StandardEventAuditLogger auditLogger = AuditLoggerFactory.getEventAuditLogger(StandardEventAuditLogger.class);
...
} catch (Exception e) {
    Context ctx = ContextBuilder.create("user", "testuser").build();
    auditLogger.loginFail(ctx, ex);
    ...
}
----

Of course the context parameter doesn't have to be there.


==== Defining a custom event

If application needs to log events which are not part of StandardEventAuditLogger
it can extend this interface with new events:

[source,java]
----
public interface CustomEventAuditLogger extends StandardEventAuditLogger {

    @AuditEvent(category = "activity", message = "Flow has failed", level = LogLevel.WARNING)
    void flowFailed(Object... args);
}
----

{javadoc_url}/org/talend/logging/audit/AuditEvent.html[AuditEvent] is an annotation which defines event metadata.

Category parameter allows to group all events into few groups. Usually events fall into
three categories: security, activity, failure. But any application is free to specify any string
value as a category.

{javadoc_url}/org/talend/logging/audit/LogLevel.html[Log level] is similar to the same concept from normal
logging frameworks, but only has three values: INFO, WARNING or ERROR.

After defining new event the app needs to obtain an instance of this interface using the same factory method:

[source,java]
----
CustomEventAuditLogger auditLogger = AuditLoggerFactory.getEventAuditLogger(CustomEventAuditLogger.class);
...
Context ctx = ContextBuilder.create("flowId", "1234").build();
auditLogger.flowFailed(ctx);
----


==== Using simple API

For exceptional cases an application may log audit messages similarly to normal logging frameworks:

[source,java]
----
AuditLogger auditLogger = AuditLoggerFactory.getAuditLogger();
...
auditLogger.warning("security", "Account has been locked");
----

First parameter is audit event category. As with event APIs, a context and/or an exception may be passed as parameters.


==== Deactivating audit logging

If audit logging needs to be deactivated for some reason, it can be done by changing the configuration:

[source,properties]
----
log.appender=none
----

NOTE: If application is running it needs to be restarted for this change to take effect.


=== Existing Technology

No existing technology has been identified as completely fulfilling the requirements
(log4j-audit was considered but rejected because it follows completely different model
which couldn't be easily adjusted for our requirements).

audit4j and inspektr could be used as backends instead of log4j (which we will use in the first release), but they
don't have some of the desired features to be used directly as company-wide audit logging API (for example,
possibility to have a catalog of standard pre-defined events which can be reused by the applications). In a way,
Audit Logging client can be compared to slf4j, while audit4j and inspektr can be compared to log4j and logback
(i.e. facade vs implementation).


=== Supported Standards

No standard specs are implemented in Audit Logging.


== Customers

=== Internal Consumers

Initially:

- TAC
- MDM

In future:

- IAM
- TDP
- ...


=== External Consumers

None expected.


== Proposed API

The framework provides two kinds of APIs:

- {javadoc_url}/org/talend/logging/audit/StandardEventAuditLogger.html[Event-based] (main)
- {javadoc_url}/org/talend/logging/audit/AuditLogger.html[Simple] (mostly for tests and very simple applications)

There are a few {audit_sample_url}[samples] that show how to use the API:

- {audit_sample_url}/src/main/java/org/talend/logging/samples/audit/events/EventMain.java[Event-based]
- {audit_sample_url}/src/main/java/org/talend/logging/samples/audit/simple/SimpleMain.java[Simple]


== Security

In the first version there will be no extra security features except those already implemented by LogServer.

In future versions we may add client authentication and/or audit event signing.
