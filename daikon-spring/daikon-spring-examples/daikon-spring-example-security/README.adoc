= Daikon Spring Security Example

== Run the examples

=== Token protected endpoints

Simply run:

```
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=token
```

This command will start a Spring Boot application on port 8080. In this setup, all Actuator endpoints are protected by a HTTP authorization token as configured in `application.properties`:

```
talend.security.token.value=token1234
```

To call Actuator endpoints, it means the following HTTP header needs to be set to call `GET http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus`:

```
Authorization: Talend token1234
```

Otherwise you will get a HTTP 403 (Forbidden).

=== Public Prometheus access

Simply run:

```
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=public-prometheus
```

This command will start a Spring Boot application on port 8080. In this setup, all Actuator endpoints are protected by a HTTP authorization token as configured in `application.properties` *except* Prometheus endpoint:

```
talend.security.token.value=token1234
```

To call Actuator endpoints, it means the following HTTP header needs to be set to call `GET http://localhost:8080/version`:

```
Authorization: Talend token1234
```

But `GET http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus` does not require authentication token.

=== No token configured

Simply run:

```
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=notoken
```

This command will start a Spring Boot application on port 8080. In this setup, all Actuator endpoints are protected but no token is configured.

When calling `GET http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus`, response will always be HTTP 503 (Service unavailable).

During application startup, you may see this message to indicate a missing configuration:

```
2019-02-11 11:36:54.436  INFO 26506 --- [           main] o.t.d.s.t.TokenSecurityConfiguration     : No token configured, protected endpoints are unavailable.
```

=== Custom secure endpoint

You can see in `org.talend.demo.actuator.SecurityConfiguration` the endpoint `/say/secure/hi` is protected using token:

```java
    @Bean
    public TokenProtectedPath protectedSayHi() {
        return () -> "/say/secure/hi";
    }
```

This means calls to `GET /say/secure/hi` will have the exact same behavior as for Actuator endpoints.
