= Daikon Spring Metrics - Example application
:toc:
:imagesdir: assets/images

== Get started

=== Start Zipkin

The easiest way to have Zipkin running locally is to use `openzipkin/zipkin` Docker image.

```
$ docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
```

=== Start application

To start application, simply launch the `run` goal of the `spring-boot` maven plugin.

```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

Default configuration provides:

- A HTTP server started on port 8080.
- Connection to Zipkin on localhost:9411 (see <Start Zipkin>).
- A Prometheus-compatible endpoint in Actuator.

== See @Timed in action

=== Single method call

To demonstrate single method call, execute the following command:

```
$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/invoke/sub"
```

Now, access Prometheus endpoint at `http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus` and search for metrics named `org_talend_demo_SubWorker_work_*`. You can see:

- Method own time (in milliseconds)
- Method invocation count

```
org_talend_demo_SubWorker_work_total{type="count",} 1.0
org_talend_demo_SubWorker_work_total{type="sum",} 3006.0
```


Open Zipkin UI at `http://localhost:9411`, you should see a trace that corresponds to the REST call and a span dedicated to method own time.

=== Nested method calls

To demonstrate nested method call, execute the following command:

```
$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/invoke"
```

Similarly to <Single method call>, you can see all metrics that got updated with new values.

Please take a moment to look how trace look like in Zipkin:

== See @VolumeMetered in action

To demonstrate data exchange monitoring, execute the following command:

```
$ curl -X POST -d "Some content" "http://localhost:8080/post"
```
Now, access Prometheus endpoint at `http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus` and search for metrics named `org_talend_demo_MetricsDemoController_post_total{type="volume",}`. You can see:

- Input stream size (that corresponds to "Some content" size).
- Output stream size (that corresponds to "Some answer", which is the response sent by server).

```
org_talend_demo_MetricsDemoController_post_total{type="in",} 24.0
org_talend_demo_MetricsDemoController_post_total{type="out",} 22.0
```
