# Contributing to the project

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:


If you plan to add some changes to the project, please keep in mind that code is not all. In fact, we would like you to follow 
some more steps to make sure that everything is done to prevent inconsistencies and other issues. Please, ascertain that:

- [ ] A [Pull Request](#pull-request) is created with 
  - valid [commit](#commit) messages
  - valid [branch](#branch-naming-conventions) names
  - rebase and [squash](#squash) to have 1 single commit message



## <a name="pull-request"></a> Pull Requests

Organize your commits to make your reviewer’s job easier. Reviewers normally prefer multiple small pull requests, instead of a 
single large pull request. 


Here is the workflow for pull requests.

1. Submit your pull request (PR name must match [commit name](#commit)).
   => our jenkins should kick 2 builds, one on the branch you have created and one with the branch merged into master.
   So you should see this nice image on github after a while.
   
   ![compProp](https://github.com/Talend/components/wiki/images/Pull_Requests_all_ok_Talend_components.png)
   
   The first green check indicates that the branch build is fine, the label "Merged build passed" indicates that the merge to master build is fine. 
2. If you receive an email notification that there is a build issue please fix it. No PR will be reviewed if the build has failed.
3. Once the quality checks are OK, and you need your PR to be reviewed you must use the label **Need review**. If your PR is still a work in progress, use the **Work in progress (do not merge)** label.
4. The components owners will then identify who is going to do the review and then 
it. The reviewer will receive an automatic mail notification.
5. Once the reviewer starts the review, he/she should set the label **Reviewing**.
6. Once the review is done, the reviewer has 3 alternatives states:
  * **Can be merged**, the reviewer is happy with the PR so the PR can be merged. The reviewer should set the label *Can be Merged*. This is the author of the PR that [merge and squash](#squash) the PR and remove the branch. If the author does not have the right to do so, it will assign it back to the Reviewer after rework so that it can be merged.
  * **Can be merged after rework**, The review is fine but requires some minor (cosmetic) adjustments that do not need to be reviewed again. The PR is then assigned back to the PR's author for some minor work. Once the work is done the author can directly [merge and squash](#squash) the PR and remove the branch without the need of any review. If the author does not have the right to do so, it will assign it back to the Reviewer after rework so that it can be merged.
  * **Rework Required**, the review added some comments that need work to be done and another review is required after. The reviewer assigns it to the PR author.
7. if **Rework Required** once assigned to the PR author, he/she has to make the required changes and then assign it back to the initial Reviewer. Then back to step 5.



Here are the label definitions for this workflow (label name : color code) :
* Need review                   : #fef2c0
* Reviewing                     : #fbca04
* Can be merged                 : #0e8a16
* Can be merged after rework    : #c2e0c6
* Rework required               : #1d76db
* Work in progress(do not merge): #0052cc


## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

We have a few rules over how our git commit messages should be formatted, in order to improve readability. 

### Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The
header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 72 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

#### Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.
In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

#### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **doc**: Documentation only changes
* **chore**: code refactoring, changes to the build process, auxiliary tools 
  and libraries such as documentation generation

#### Scope
The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. Most of the time it should be JIRA ticket reference followed by a useful context.

For example `TFD-66/webapp`, `TFD-67/cli`, `TPSVC-123`, `svc-datastore`, etc...

#### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mode in the subject line

#### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behaviour.

- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

#### Footer
The footer should contain

* any information about **Breaking Changes**
* [Smart commits](https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/using-smart-commits-298976812.html) (aka JIRA commands)

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

#### Examples

```
feat(TPSVC-38/webapp): analyse more flowchart libraries

* Add JointJS, JIT, JSNetworkX
* Add references on non OSS libs
* Remove canvg

#time 1h
#comments JointJS seems great
```

## Branch naming conventions

Name your branch according to the following convention:

```username/JIRA-ID-short_description```

so that the branch can easily be traced back to you.

The first part of the branch name after ```username/``` should be the jira-id, followed by a hyphen and a short description. Use underscores to separate words in the short description.

## <a name="squash"></a> Squash

Within a pull request, a relatively small number of commits that break the problem into logical steps 
is preferred. For most pull requests, you’ll squash your changes down to 1 commit. You can use the following command to re-order, 
squash, edit, or change description of individual commits.

```git rebase -i <branch-name>```

You’ll then push to your branch on GitHub. 

Note: when updating your commit after pull request feedback, you should not force the push, otherwise you'll lose the comments from the Pull Request. In this case, you can simply pull, merge, and then push.

In addition to that, Git provides a tool to squash and merge at the bottom of the Pull Request page.
